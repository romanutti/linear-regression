Estimate the price of real estate using linear regression with different features, Module ml@FHNW.

## Getting Started

The following instructions are intended to help you get the MATLAB project up and running.

### Documentation

The results are summarized in the pdf-file *assignment_1.pdf*. A version including the source code used for this can be found in the file *assignment_1_source.pdf*.

### Prerequisites

The main script was developed and tested as a MATLAB live script. A MATLAB version supporting live scripts must be used.

### Run scripts

The code can be executed by running the *assignment_1.mlx* script as a MATLAB live script. Running the entire script may take some time, as explorative analyses for some excercises go through a large number of iterations.
